 * 
 * SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (a.k.a. keyed hash functions) optimized for speed on short messages. 
 * Target applications include network traffic authentication and defense against hash-flooding DoS attacks. 
 *  - https://131002.net/siphash/
 *
 * The library implements siphash PRF. The implementation does not utilize 64-bit integer arithmetics.
